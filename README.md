Psyche - IRC in Tlc/Tk
===============

I wrote/am writing/have written Psyche for the following reasons:

Psyche is:

Tiny
---
This summer semester at school, I am forced to use Windows machines with a temporary
profile, meaning my options are either Mibbit or re-downloading Hexchat, or even irssi,
every day. Most clients I prefer (Konversation, Quassel, Hexchat, etc) are hefty,
and I'm still not into using irssi on Windows.

All the small GUI programs I found for Windows either required .NET (which, on a school
computer, is a gamble), were feature incomplete/hard to use, and -most importantly- were
abandoned.

Tcl/Tk
---
As a user and a dev, I love Qt. But there are already some fantastic Qt clients out there,
and it's a little hefty to ship with the DLL and all, or -on Linux- the huge Qt package.

As a user, I love Tcl/Tk because it's cross platform, incredibly small, and incredibly fast.
(I'm not sure what I think of it as a dev just yet. I can definitely say that it's different.)

Open-source

Duh.

A butterfly

In case you're curious, this semester I'm taking a "Concepts of the Soul" philosophy class for
my philosophy minor, and one recurring theme is that in various cultures, a butterfly or moth
is often associated with the soul. And in Greek, the word for "butterfly" is actually the same
as the word for "butterfly", and that word is "psyche".


Further notes
=====
As much as I have enjoyed working on Psyche so far, I have more of an obligation to my open-source apps
that I already have existing, so Psyche will most likely be an 'on the weekends' thing....hopefully.

License
---
I've decided to go ahead and release Psyche under the BSD license. Because Fuck yeah, free software!

Icons
---
The icons I am (currently) using for Psyche are compliments of David Keegan[https://github.com/kgn/kgn_icons],
which are released under a loose license. He's totally cool like that.

The logo icon (the butterfly) is compliments of Ergosign
[http://www.iconarchive.com/show/free-spring-icons-by-ergosign/butterfly-icon.html],
which is released under the CC BY-NC-ND 3.0. Which is still pretty cool.
